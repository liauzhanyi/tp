### Project: SocialBook 

**SocialBook is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a seed command.
  * What it does: Allows the user to populate the contact list with sample data.
  * Justification: This feature improves user experience, especially for new users. The sample data not only makes the product look better but also provide ideas on how the some of the features, such as tags and remarks, can be useful.

* **New Feature**: Added a new *emergency contact* field to a person's contact.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI help window to include command list for better usability. 
  * Enhanced corrupt data file handling to minimise data loss.

* **Documentation**:

* **Community**:

* **Project Management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` on GitHub
